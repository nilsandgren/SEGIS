# SEGIS
A GUI SDK written in OpenGL/GLUT that I wrote back in 2005.

Complete vectorized GUI elements, support for image loading and more, but
also a lot of bugs and limitations of course.

I've always wanted to port this to GLFW, but that hasn't happened yet.

Some additional installs (deb-style):
  sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
  sudo apt-get install libboost-filesystem-dev
  sudo apt-get install libfreeimage-dev
  sudo apt-get install libfreetype-dev
